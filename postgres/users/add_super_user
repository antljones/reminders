You need to create the user with the login option so that local connections can be made from website/app orms and so that you can run postgres commands from the OS command line using that user. You must either be the postgres user or another super user to use this.

CREATE ROLE <yourrolename> WITH LOGIN PASSWORD '<yourpassword>' SUPERUSER;
