You can find the package architecture by running:

yum search <yourpackagename>

This will list (usually multiple packages) containing the package name string. This is appended by the architecture type:

x86 - for 32bit libraries
x86_64 - for 64bit libraries
.noarch - usable on both 32 and 64 bit architectures
